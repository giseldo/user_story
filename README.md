# Title
A tool to help teams that use agile practices to building better user stories.

The tool User Story Tutor (aka UST) receives as input a User Story text in
English and presents personalized recommendations for improving it, with the support of a large language model (LLM). LLMs are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The tool also presents a prediction in Story Points,
generated by a machine learning algorithm trained with data from other projects. The user is also presented with the User Storyâ€™s readability indexes, as they can be used to represent an indicator of text clarity 

Our idea is that UST supports agile teams during the construction of User Stories and assists the development process during the User Story preparation phase and in estimating task effort. UST consists basically of a web application that can be accessed us-
ing a browser on mobile devices, PCs, and notebooks.
UST uses an LLM provided by OpenIA to recommend improvements and present readability indexes. 

The application was designed around 3 modules with well-defined functions. The Recommender module responds to User Story recommender requests. It is responsible for maintaining the prompt and combining it with the text of the new User Story, query-
ing OpenAI via API, and preparing the return for presentation to the user. The module that performs User Story estimates in Story Points uses a predictive model, already trained with historical data to assist developers in their estimates, acting as a reference for
the team responsible for estimating effort. Readability indexes are extracted from text with basic natural language processing techniques. 

For coding, we used StreamLit, a library for building open-source applications for machine learning and data science. The Recommender Module performs a query to OpenAI. The scikit-learn libraries were also used.
